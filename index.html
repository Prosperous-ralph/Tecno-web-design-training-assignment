                The revolution of technology exposed us to a lot of internet features which enhance learning skills which includes but not limited to  Google classroom, Online training kit, webinar, podcast,  distance learning, etc., which serve as tools for virtual learning.
            </p>
            
            <h2> What is virtual learning?</h2>
            
             <p class="main-text">
            Virtual learning is a  learning experience that is enhanced through utilizing computers and/or the internet both outside and inside the facilities of the educational organization. Teaching activities are carried out online whereby the teacher and learners are physically separated (in terms of place, time, or both).
            
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
                 Due to the corona virus pandemic, physical academic activities were put on hold on campuses all over the country due to the spread of the deadly disease through body contact. Every citadel of learning was shutdown leaving the classroom empty. A lot of students look for other means of enhancing their skills and potentials through virtual learning.
            
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
            
                 Some courses such as Business administration, photography, entrepreneurship development and the likes can be studied virtually without a personal contact with the tutors or lecturers through the internet with the aid of YouTube videos, PDFs and word documents, hence continuous learning is made possible through virtual learning. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
                Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Adopt virtual learning process through Google classroom due to the prolong lock down for  the pandemic ravaging the whole country. This decision seems so good but have adverse effect on the teaching-learning  process of the university. Lecturers only send materials such as PDFs, PPT docs, word docs and videos to students on Google classroom without detail explanation. Virtual learning process enable the lecturers to assess students by giving assignments and test on Google classroom.
            
            </p>
            
            <h2>Prons & cons of Virtual learning</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Virtual learning is said to be convenient, time saving, cheap and effective but not sufficient to replace the importance of Physical learning in our modern age. Physical learning create a medium for inter-personal relationship between the lecturer and the students and also enable the lecturer to focus on the improvements and physical assessment of student's performance in the course of study,  the students will also have the opportunity to engage their lecturers in meaningful discussion which will aid their understanding in the course of study. 
            
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
                 Moreover, since attendance is important, the student will put in their efforts to be available for their classes compare to virtual learning where students take their course work with levity because  physical appearance is not important. Some students may find it difficult to read through their materials online which may result to procrastinating and postponement of useful activities that will help them understand the course better. This is not allowed in physical courses because your activeness earn you points in becoming an expert in that course of study. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
            
            Students face a lot of issues due to digital divide because of network failures, high cost of data, fluctuating power supply, inadequate learning environment, inaccessible learning aids etc. Some students could not meet up with lectures on Google meets and submit assignment late. Students participation in meaningful discussion reduced drastically.
     

            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
            
            Some engineering courses can not be studied online due to the need for practical and technical know how which cannot be achieved by studying virtually.
            
            </p>
            
            <p class="main-text">
                The effect of virtual learning on teaching-learning process in OAU can not be over emphasized, virtual learning is effective but can not be used as a perfect substitute for physical learning, it can rather be a complimentary method to aid effective learning.
